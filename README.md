## PokeMatchTrio

This is Mahjong Solitaire but with your favorite creatures.
You have to obtain them elsewhere though.

## Installation
 https://github.com/PMDCollab/SpriteCollab

 Download the portrait folder from the link above and put it into ```public/assets/``` and ```src/assets```

 Afterwards run
```pnpm install```

Check if everything is good by running:
```pnpm dev run```

Afterwards you can build the project with:
```pnpm dev build```

The result will be saved in dist, and this is the folder you want to serve to the web, for example with Python:
```
cd dist
python -m http.server
```
